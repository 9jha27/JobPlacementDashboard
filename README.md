# Live Project

<h3>Introduction</h3>

During my time at the Tech Academy, I had the opportunity the rare opportunity to work on a live project which not only alowed me to utilize the technical skills I had learned with the academy, but also allowed me to work in an Agile/Scrum environment.

The live project I was a part of was built using ASP .Net MVC and Entity Framework. It was built for local theater company in Portland, Oregon to be a content management service (CMS) so that those from the company would be able to easily manage their website without needing to manage code. During the two week sprint, I was able to work both front end and back end stories. While I dedicated much of my time on front end stories, I also improved certain pages to incorporate dynamic syntax on back end stories. Working full-stack provided me with experience identifying bugs more quickly and understanding a larger overview of how apps are created on both client and server side.
